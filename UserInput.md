Explanation:

1. **Imports:**

   - Import the `React` library.

2. **Functional Component:**

   - Create a functional component named `UserInput` that takes three props: `searchTerm`, `onSearch`, and `onInputChange`.

3. **JSX Structure:**
   - Render a `div` containing an `input` field for the search term and a `button` for triggering the search.
   - The input field's value is controlled by the `searchTerm` prop.
   - The `onChange` event is handled by the `onInputChange` prop.
   - The button click event is handled by the `onSearch` prop.
